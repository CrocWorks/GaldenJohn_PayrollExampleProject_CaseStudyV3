Per Scholas Java 2022 Final Case Study


Current build connects to a MySQL database and updates, adds, or deletes employees from the database.

Database holds information for first name, last name, email, payrate, hours, and pay.

Known issues and outstanding tasks:
Login only checks if you have correct values
Going to the list from the navigation bar does not properly connect to the database and will show a blank database
  To properly show the database, you will have to add and delete a new employee
When adding or updating an employee, checks need to be added to ensure not-null and number values where appropriate
